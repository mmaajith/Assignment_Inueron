    "### 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "OOPs main goal is organizing real-world entities and interactions using classes and objects. This boosts code reusability and problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "### Answer: \n",
    "object is an instance of a class, combining data and methods for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "### Answer: \n",
    "A Python class is a blueprint that defines structure and behavior for objects.A class contains attributes to store data and methods to perform actions or operations related to that data.\n",

    "- **Class Variables**: These are shared among all instances of the class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods. They store data that is common to all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variables**: These are unique to each instance of the class. They are defined within methods using the self keyword. They store data that varies from instance to instance.\n",
